# BeerMe
BeerMe! is a web application designed to find breweries and craft beer bars in a designated city. The default location is set to Chicago, IL.

BeerMe is built with a React front end, Ruby and Sinatra on the back end, and utilizes both Google Maps and Places APIs along with the BreweryDB API to get brewery information and locations.
